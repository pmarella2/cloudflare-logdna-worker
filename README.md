# cloudflare-dnalog-worker
a cloudflare worker script to forward logs to [logdna](https://logdna.com/)

## how to use
copy index.js content into your worker
change myApp and myHostName into whatever you want, read the logdna [Ingest API](https://docs.logdna.com/v1.0/reference#api)

* maxRequestsPerBatch - how many requests to maximum batch per sending, by default it send all the batched requests once per 10 seconds

## about compiledPass

you should precompile your logdna ingestion key and store it in the compilePass parameters, you can simply type in console `btoa(username+':'+password)` where username is your ingestion key and password keep empty, and put the results into the parameter to save some cpu time(probably)


I left all the console.log command to better help you debug
